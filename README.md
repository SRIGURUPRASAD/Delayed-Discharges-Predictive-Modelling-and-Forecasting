# Delayed-Discharges-Predictive-Modelling-and-Forecasting
The main objective of this project is to Develop a predictive model logic based algorithm in SQL in accordance to the predictive model developed earlier with R, to predict the possibilities of Delayed discharges and secondly to analyse the Delayed Discharges of the patients in Govt.Hospital and provide forecasts of various indicators for future months.  The scope of the project can be divided into two different phases as stated below,  2.1 Phase1: The main objective of this phase is to automate (SSIS package integration) the data (features of the patients) extraction from the integrated mutidimensional data storage which was previously loaded into data base through various integration jobs in Microsoft SQL server. Develop a new predictive model with Machine Learning algorithm in R . To support the model developed to predict the possibilities of a patient delaying discharge based on the previous historic data by automating the data analysis (required features of the patient by the model) and providing a daily automatic email Discharge team based on the output from the newly developed patient score calculating algorithm.    2.2 Phase 2: The main objective of this phase is to analyse the historic data to find trends and seasonality measures in order to foresee the occurrences of the delayed discharges and associated indicators e.g. care home availability over a short or long term as expected by Gov.Uk Hospitals.  Various forecasting techniques can be used based on the data availability. 
It involved extensive analysis of multidimensional patientâ€™s data like mental health, cardiovascular complaints, general health, history of records from the hospital database. Process and data modelling of this project included data management, process methodology development, statistical modelling in R with ML techniques (multilinear regression, mixed effect logistic regression ARIMA, stepwise and determination of coefficient factor approach for feature selection).
