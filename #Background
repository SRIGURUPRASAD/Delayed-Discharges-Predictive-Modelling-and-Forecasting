#Background
The Scottish Government has an ambition to reduce the number of patients who are delayed discharges from hospitals. A “delayed discharge” is defined as an inpatient who is mentally, physically, clinically healthy enough and ready to be discharged from the hospital care but who prolongs in occupying the hospital beds beyond the ready for discharge date. 
Govt.UK Hospitals is the national level healthcare provider in UK.  It is the non – departmental public body concentrating public health care. It is devolved to national governments in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.  It is part of National hospitals Scotland and is one of the 14 health boards that provides health services to around 288,000 people across the Forth Valley region of central Scotland. 
This project has two phases; First it focuses on developing a predictive model for Delayed Discharges of the admitted patients in the hospital, to utilise a derived prediction model with automated extraction of required patient details from the databases.  Secondly to Forecast the likely demand and availability of resources (eg care home places) for future months.
